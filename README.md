  ## Description
  This challenge project demonstrates the ability to modify starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

  ## Usage
  The application successfully creates a new note, adding it to the database and rendering the note to the page. However, while there is code to delete a note and it does successfully delete the note from the database, I ran out of time trying to debug the render to the page without restarting the server.
